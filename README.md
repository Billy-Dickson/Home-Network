# Home Network
This repository holds the documentation of my home network I've built up from guides and other online information feel free to use this as a starting point or as a source of information when your building your own home network. Building a  home network is the best way to learn, and can be much cheaper than you think.

### Network Diagram
This is my current network diagram.  I used [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) to create the diagram.
### My Hardware
Below is the hardware I use to run my home network. My network works great for me and my familys needs, and could probably support a small office or home office easily if needed.
